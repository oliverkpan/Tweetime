# Tweetime

### About
Recently, I have been interested in learning about NLP. This is my first project, which analyses whether a tweet is positive or negative. This can be used to help filter negative content from viewers.

### Current Progress
Currently, I have deployed the app to Streamlit locally. I am hoping to use Heroku so that this can be used by various users.
